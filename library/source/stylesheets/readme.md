# Sass Directory

> A Sass directory with simple & smart initial styles, and room to grow.

[View the example output of this Sass directory](http://beaucharman.github.io/bonsai).

## Notes

**[Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)**

Normalize creates an invaluable blank slate for which to begin building application styles.

**Current version, Normalize.css v2.1.2**

Normalize.css is inlcuded in the `includes/_normalize.scss` file, however the newest version can be obtained via [Normalize's GitHub project page](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), or via Bower:

`bower install --save normalize-css`

**[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)**

Bourbon is a really awesome, lightweight and non opinionated / uncluttered mixin library.

This can be installed and then included in the Sass Directory via [Bourbon's GitHub project page](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon).

**[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)**

> Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

You can include font awesome stright from the Bootsrap CDN, via:

```html
<link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/3.2.1/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Or, check out [other options](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/).
